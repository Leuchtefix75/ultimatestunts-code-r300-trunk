                Ultimate Stunts source code
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This package contains the sourcecode of the 3D racing game 
"Ultimate Stunts". You can configure it and compile it according
to the instructions in the documentation.

Ultimate Stunts, data files for Ultimate Stunts and the documentation
of Ultimate Stunts are available on its website:
http://www.ultimatestunts.nl

The source code in this package is divided in several directories.
The code in the directories "shared", "filetransfer", "graphics" and
"simulation" is compiled into *.a static libraries. The code in the
directories "stunts3dedit", "stuntsai", "stuntsserver", "trackedit" and
"ultimatestunts" will be linked with those static libraries, generating
a different binary executable in each directory.

The source code can be edited with kdevelop. The kdevelop-file is available
in this directory.


-----------------
Configure options
-----------------

Sound libraries:
Ultimate Stunts can compile with either OpenAL or FMOD as sound target. By
default, configure first tries to find OpenAL, and and if that fails, it
tries to find FMOD. You can bypass the default behavior with the following
options:

--with-openal
--with-fmod

--with-openal always tries to use OpenAL, and completely ignores the presence of
FMOD. If OpenAL is not found, Ultimate Stunts is configured without sound support.

--with-fmod always tries to use FMOD, and completely ignores the presence of
OpenAL. If FMOD is not found, Ultimate Stunts is configured without sound support.

===================================================================================
this is a copy of the unchanged r300 version for my research, the original code is puplished under the GPL lizense
the game has 4x wheel dynamic's!
it is as best to the original 4D-Sports/Stunts and at least the only "clone" I got compiled
with some little modifications I got it run at 800x600 60Hz on a RPI3 powered by NOOBS/Raspbian(X11/ARMv7+)

#build and install (what the compiler finaly does): 
#    Lexer - break the program up into words
#    Parser - check that the syntax of the sentences are correct
#    Semantic Analysis - check that the sentences make sense
#    Optimizer - edit the sentences for brevity (the -O<> flag for example)
#    Code generator - output something with equivalent semantic meaning using another vocabulary (Linker against libraries)
make
make install

#in my example the changed tracks and the .conf file can be found in /home/pi/.ultimatestunts

#similar games I were able to run
NeedForMadnes2 -is a arcade racing fun game, it needs JRE7 which is deprecaded, or someone who fix the code, or version 3
StuntCarRacing -lowpoly + lowframerate racing on a wall, but still fun ...if you find the NO2 button
